** My (pretty small) emacs config
It's an init file, and I think it's pretty neat.

** Some things worth stealing

 - An inital configuration to make emacs a bit more modern looking and less
   annoying, without bloating it to death
 - Packages configured with [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SetupEl][setup.el]]
 - Declarative package management with [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight]] or [[https://guix.gnu.org/][guix]]
 - Decent amount of configured packages for everyday things (programming
   helpers, completion with ivy/company, magit)
 - Never forget another key chord with [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]]
 - Some helper functions for getting around quick, one key to open conifg file
